## Contributors

We love contributions! Below is a simple contributor list. If you'd like to be added, please open a pull request that adds your entry to this list.

Format (choose one):

- Simple list item (preferred):

```
- [@github-username](https://github.com/github-username) — Full Name — Short bio or role. (Optional: ![avatar](https://github.com/github-username.png))
```

- Or a short two-line entry:

```
- [@github-username](https://github.com/github-username)
	- Full Name — Short bio or role
```

Guidelines
- Keep entries alphabetical by GitHub username.
- Keep bios short (1 line).
- Use your GitHub username link so others can find you.
- A profile avatar image is optional. If you include one, keep it small — recommended 32×32 pixels — to avoid large images in the list. You can use raw Markdown or a small HTML image for sizing:

Preferred small-avatar example (recommended):

```
- [@github-username](https://github.com/github-username) — Full Name — Short bio. <img src="https://github.com/github-username.png" width="32" height="32" style="border-radius:50%;vertical-align:middle;margin-left:8px" alt="avatar" />
```

Alternatively a simple markdown image (size not enforced by markdown):

```
- [@github-username](https://github.com/github-username) — Full Name — Short bio. ![avatar](https://github.com/github-username.png)
```

Example

- [@marmikitpl-dev](https://github.com/marmikitpl-dev) — Marmik Soni — Project owner and maintainer. <img src="https://github.com/marmikitpl-dev.png" width="32" height="32" style="border-radius:50%;vertical-align:middle;margin-left:8px" alt="avatar" />

Add yourself by editing this file and adding your entry under the Contributors section. Once you submit a PR, a maintainer will review and merge it.
